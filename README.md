# Unsupervised-Learning-on-cell-nuclei-of-human-breast-masses


The goal of model is to apply complete analysis using the unsupervised learning techniques. Using PCA as a preprocessing step to clustering using data that consist of measurements of cell nuclei of human breast masses.

2 main unsupervised techniques are used here, namely  K-Means() & Hierarchical Clustering.

It is a good introduction for anyone who wants to know about Unsupervised clustering and how this is used in a real world scenerio. 

PCA is an important preprocessign step which should be used in case there is significant variance in the data.
